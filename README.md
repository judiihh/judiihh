## 🎀 Hey there, I’m Judith Espinal

I'm a **Software Engineer at Celligence | Sun West Mortgage Company**, where I bring automation to life and turn mortgage business problems into tech solutions that make a real difference. By day, I'm coding and debugging in a fast-paced, real-world environment — and by night, I’m leveling up my skills as a **full-time Software Engineering student at Holberton School**, diving deep into data structures, C, Python, web development, and everything in between.

My path into tech wasn't traditional, but it was definitely meant to be. With a background in **Medical Technology** and a passion for problem-solving, I transitioned into the world of code looking to make a bigger impact — and I found my spark. ✨ Today, I’m fully immersed in tech, with a love for **clean front-end designs**, **automation**, and building software that actually matters.

Outside of work and school, I recharge through my **faith**, **anime marathons**, **cozy series**, and **gaming sessions** 🎮📺📖 (when I can find the time — LOL). I believe in mixing **passion with purpose**, and I'm just getting started. Ready to keep learning, building, and sharing this journey with the world. 💫
